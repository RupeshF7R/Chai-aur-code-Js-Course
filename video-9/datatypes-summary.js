/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that variables do not need to be declared with a specific data type, and the data type of a variable can change at runtime. This can be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it makes JavaScript code more flexible and easier to write. On the other hand, it can lead to errors if the programmer is not careful.
